                  <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor="#aos0" data-aos-delay="200">The Tourism Administration was officially inaugurated in September 2023. On September 15, 2024, it celebrated the first anniversary of its transformation from the Tourism Bureau. To mark the occasion, the Administration hosted the 2024 Taiwan Sustainable Tourism Summit Forum at the GIS MOTC Convention Center, alongside the themed exhibition “Glorious Taiwan: Sustainable Tourism, Connecting with the World.” The exhibition highlighted the past, present, and future of Taiwan’s tourism. From the Tourism Bureau to the Tourism Administration, the baton has been passed with excellence at every stage, bringing together industry leaders and the public, both at home and abroad, to join hands in shaping a new era for Taiwan’s tourism.</p>

              <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor="#aos0" data-aos-delay="800">In response to international tourism trends and changes after the pandemic, Taiwan is advancing along the twin pillars of "Sustainability, Resilience, and Digital Innovation," as outlined in the "Tourism 2025 – Toward 2025" program, with the aim of achieving sustainable tourism development by 2030. This effort is aligned with national policies such as the Special Act for Enhancing Economic and Social Resilience and Public Sharing of Economic Achievement in the Post-pandemic Era (including measures to accelerate the attraction of international tourists and improve public transportation to tourist sites), developing key and forward-looking tourist attractions, and advancing the 0403 Hualien Earthquake Tourism Revitalization Plan. Furthermore, in line with the Executive Yuan's directive passed on May 30, 2024, to “enhance tourism highlights and drive a trillion-dollar industry,” the strategy integrates sustainability, resilience, and digital innovation as key principles to further attract international visitors to Taiwan.</p>

            </div>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor="#aos0" data-aos-delay="1200">In 2024, Taiwan welcomed 7,857,686 inbound visitors, up 21.13% from 2023 (6,486,951), showing steady and sustained growth. The Japan, Hong Kong–Macau, and South Korea markets each exceeded one million visitors. The European and American markets also recovered strongly, with the US market performing particularly well—up 7.64% compared to pre-pandemic levels—showing a solid recovery of inbound tourism.</p>

                  </div>
                </div>
                <p class="list_parag" data-aos="fade-up">Flexible promotion under a new tourism brand: On May 6, 2024, the Tourism Administration launched the Tourism Brand 3.0: TAIWAN-Waves of Wonder. Image advertisements were broadcast intensively in various city markets to promote Taiwan's tourism image. In Q4 2024, a new international promotional video was released, pairing the 3.0 brand with influential media channels in major source markets (including BBC in the UK, CNN in the US, outdoor screens in New York's Times Square, and digital platforms such as Netflix, Google, and YouTube). New annual tourism ambassadors were also introduced in the Japan, Korea, Malaysia (Muslim), Indonesia, Thailand, and Philippines markets, featuring prominent stars such as Japanese actor Satoshi Tsumabuki, South Korean Kyuhyun of Super Junior, Malaysian actress Nabila Razali, Indonesian superstar Mikha Tambayoung Mahenra, Thai actor Teeradetch Metawarayut, and Philippine celebrities Gabbi Garcia and Khalil Ramo. These campaigns and representatives generated buzz about Taiwan tourism to drive visitor growth.</p>
                <p class="list_parag" data-aos="fade-up">Expanding Taiwan's international presence and further developing new markets: In 2024, the Tourism Administration successively established Taiwan Tourism Information Center (TTIC) offices in Jakarta, Mumbai, Paris, Vancouver, and Manila. It also drew up plans to progressively add TTICs in Sydney, Amsterdam, Seattle, and other cities to develop future source markets.</p>
                <p class="list_parag" data-aos="fade-up">Attracting Visitors through the Inbound Tourism Revitalization Plan: Under the "Tourism 2025 – Broadening Tourism Source Markets Plan," incentives were provided for overseas companies to send tour groups to Taiwan, with 165 groups (approximately 14,881 visitors) applying in 2024. To encourage international visitors to explore Taiwan's outlying islands, on November 12, 2024, the Guidelines on Subsidies for International Charter Flights to Taiwan were revised to lower eligibility thresholds for island-bound charters. Cruise tourism promotion involved integrating shore excursion resources at six major cruise ports including Kaohsiung and Taichung, and publishing a new cruise guide and brochure. Subsidy programs for inbound cruises and "Fly-Cruise" packages continued, supporting both port-of-call visits and homeport itineraries. In 2024, nine cruise voyages applied for subsidies, recovering to about 70% of the pre-pandemic (2019) level. On July 10, 2024, the Fly-Cruise subsidy guidelines were revised to include domestic travel agencies as eligible applicants and simplify application procedures.</p>
                <p class="list_parag" data-aos="fade-up">Five-Pronged Approach to Accelerate International Visitor Growth: The Tourism Administration promoted the "Accelerated and Expanded Inbound Tourism Promotion Program" was actively promoted to boost both free independent traveler (FIT) and group arrivals starting in May 2023. More than 4.61 million people participated in the 2024 FIT travel spending lottery campaign, while over 24,000 tour groups totaling more than 430,000 group members, applied for subsidies. The five-pronged approach included: participating in overseas travel fairs in target markets, hosting seminars and promotional events, running digital video advertisements, placing out-of-home (OOH) advertising, and inviting key opinion leaders (KOLs) for visits combined with social media marketing.</p>
                <p class="list_parag" data-aos="fade-up">Integrating Resources and Expanding Inter-Agency Cooperation to Accelerate Tourism Development: The vice premier held monthly Interdepartmental Project Meetings on Promoting Tourism Travel to Taiwan, with 16 sessions held in 2024. Each meeting set target visitor numbers for specific markets and coordinated agency efforts to attract international travelers. The Executive Yuan Tourism Industry Revitalization Advisory Council was also established, chaired by the vice premier. The meetings fostered inter-ministerial cooperation, engaged experts, and encouraged industry dialogue to integrate tourism resources and accelerate industry growth.</p>
