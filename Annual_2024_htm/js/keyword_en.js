To realize the vision of a tourism-based country, the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) was restructured as the Taiwan Tourism Administration (TTA) on September 15, 2023. This much-anticipated evolution marks a significant milestone in Taiwans tourism development. The TTAs 2023 Annual Report showcases the administrations achievements during a transformative year, from industry partnerships to the integration of tourism resources and the unlocking of new opportunities for tourism ahead.The year 2023 brought COVID-era restrictions in Taiwan to an end and set the stage for a remarkable recovery in tourism. We welcomed 6.48 million international visitors, meeting both our target and high quality demands. As the world embraces sustainability and aims for a net-zero target by 2050, the TTA is leading Taiwans tourism industry into a sustainable and digital future and expanding tourism highlights to drive a trillion NT dollar industry. We will accomplish these key policy objectives through the four major strategies: Tourism Branding: Attracting 10 Million Visitors, Cross-Island Travel: Expanding Domestic Tourism, Inter-regional Integration: Diversifying Experiences, and Smart Scenic Areas: Adding Value.To fast-track the recovery of inbound visitors to Taiwan, the TTA inaugurated a new office in Busan, South Korea, bringing the global total to 16 branches. We strengthened international marketing and inter-ministerial communication and coordination, and promoted incentives for individual and group travel. We also partnered with the International Trade Administration, Ministry of Economic Affairs to attract international business travelers to Taiwan. Building on this inter-ministerial cooperation, we will continue to cultivate key markets in Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia, strengthen our presence in the North American and Muslim markets and cruise industry, and tap markets in Indonesia and India. We are also deepening international bilateral ties to foster more exchange visits and establishing and deploying air and sea support systems to market Taiwan tourism internationally. With eyes on key and potential visitor source markets, we are opening up new flight points and expanding capacity of direct transport links, as well as joining the strengths of international cruise lines and airlines to grow the Fly Cruise market for international visitors. In 2024, the TTA will launch a new tourism brand: TAIWAN, Waves of Wonder, continue promotions at large-scale travel exhibitions, promotional meetings, traditional media, social platforms, and outdoor advertising to broaden market outreach, present Taiwan to the world, and invite the world to discover all we have to offer.In the area of smart scenic sites, we are leveraging new technologies including 5G, big data, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and VR immersive experiences, to strengthen the competitiveness of scenic areas in Taiwan. We are advancing in the area of sustainable development, as well as connecting the essential elements of travel—accommodation, recreation, and transportation. We are also developing a tourism cloud that lets travelers worldwide experience the beauty of Taiwan remotely through shared smart service systems. At the same time, we are deploying a four-pronged development strategy encompassing: cross-domain integration to promote local economic potential (creative marketing, cross-industry alliances, and tourism circle market days), strengthening international market matching, and promoting local organizational momentum. These initiatives aim to refashion tourism circles as sustainable entities, expand scenic area economies, and promote green and sustainable tourism. We are also helping businesses put ESG into action and gain international sustainability certifications, working hand-in-hand with tourism operators to reach the goal of sustainable tourism.Taiwan is a unique alpine island with a diverse topography, ecology, and cultural landscapes and friendly and enthusiastic people. The island-round rail system, cycling routes, and national greenways paved by our ancestors are all among Taiwans essential tourism resources. As countries compete for visitors in the post-pandemic era, Taiwan is attracting the world under the themes of Enjoy the Mountains, Embrace the Sea, and Explore the Island. We aim to shift the global perception of Taiwan from Made in Taiwan to Brand in Taiwan, and towards Taiwan as a Brand, creating an international tourism brand capturing the Brand Taiwan, Charming Taiwan, Smart Taiwan spirit to present Taiwan to the world as one-of-a-kind travel destination.The restructuring into the Tourism Administration in 2023 marked a major step in the evolution of tourism in Taiwan. Each member of the administration and the tourism industry plays a key role in this transformation and share a sense of mission and passion for this land. With a vision of Bringing Taiwans Unique Charms to Light, we will continue to build Taiwans tourism value sustainably, welcome international visitors, bring tourism-driven economic benefits to local communities, power Taiwans overall development, and lift Taiwans tourism industry to a new trillion NT dollar peak.";
